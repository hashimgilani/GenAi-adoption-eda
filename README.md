# Enterprise GenAI Adoption — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project analyzes a dataset of 100k+ enterprise records related to Generative AI (GenAI) adoption across industries, countries, and job functions. The EDA uncovers meaningful trends in adoption rates, workforce impact, training hours, and productivity changes.

The goal is to understand *who is adopting GenAI, how fast, and with what outcomes*.
